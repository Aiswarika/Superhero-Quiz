          <p>
            Super Mario is a platform game series and media franchise created by Nintendo and featuring their mascot, Mario.
             Alternatively called the Super Mario Bros. series or simply the Mario series, it is the central series of the greater Mario franchise. 
             At least one Super Mario game has been released for every major Nintendo video game console. There have also been a number of Super Mario 
             video games released on non-Nintendo gaming platforms.[1] How many Super Mario games there are has been debated. There are currently twenty-one
            similar games and one cross-series game that may or may not be included as part of the series.The Super Mario games follow Mario's adventures,
            typically in the fictional Mushroom Kingdom with Mario as the player character. He is often joined by his brother, Luigi, and occasionally by 
            other members of the Mario cast. As in platform video games, the player runs and jumps across platforms and atop enemies in themed levels.
            The games have simple plots, typically with Mario rescuing the kidnapped Princess Peach from the primary antagonist, Bowser. The first game in the 
            series, Super Mario Bros., released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1985, established gameplay concepts and elements prevalent in 
            nearly every Super Mario game released since.

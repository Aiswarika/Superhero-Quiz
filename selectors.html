            23rd March 2020, in the midst of the pandemic little did i know with a millions of bad things going on, i would finallly meet My Prince charming. 
            The love of my life, my strength, my sunshine, words cant express how much you mean to me. You are the best thing happened to me in my life.
            I may be shy infront of you, n i swear my shyness stops me from complementing you, deep inside only i know how hard it is to keep myself calm and
             not act stupid infront of you.

        <p class="love">
            Gradually we began to tell each other about ourselves we both were surely different yet we connected so effortlessly. Talking to you, was, is and would be the best 
            part of my day. Merely thinking about you makes my cheeks go red. Even during typing this i wish you were here to see how stupid i look rn.
            We started playing games ludo to begin with, i swear I was never so interested in playing ludo before, nor loosing matches seemed so much fun to me.

        <p class="you">
            Then we started sharing our secrets. I know you were a bit hesitant at first but little did my prince know that soon this "not so trustworthy" person would turn into his
            human diary. Every night the poet in us or morelike the dukhi atma and the baba in us would come alive and then we would be motivating each other till one of us feels sleepy.
            Pura din sara ete chutiyaap karibu even crime scenes bhi enact kardabu but sensible katha asibani rati hau hau di jana ku kana bhuta chade ki zoooppp 9ta pare di jana 
            Shakespear, Sandeep Maheswari combined.

        <p class= "you jou">
            I still remember that day when u first told me "tu pura naruto" and i didnt even knew who he was, cut to now, I literally know everything about him, that show, the chakras, 
            jutsus, about the chutiya akatsuki shinobis and still I would want you to tell me more and more. Listening to you talking about naruto being super excited is such a treat.
            I never knew my strong handsome prince would make "The most talkative Girl in the World" go speechless. I love you Jou. Teeehee. 
            And I'm pretending you ain't been on my mind
            But I took an interest in the things that you like.
            *WINK*. To be continued.
